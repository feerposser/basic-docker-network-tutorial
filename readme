# Using same network in containers outside docker-compose

Sometimes you need to connect services defined in diferent composes. On those cases, you need to connect both services in a single network.

Docker implements the "networks" top level definition for network config for services. Using that resource, we can provide a default configuration on running containers and other composes.

Docker by default creates tree network: bridge, host and none.

-------docker network ls image

## bridge

Create a bridge between containers. Can be used for connect services. When a docker-compose with multiple services up, docker create a default network for connection between services layers.

--------- IMAGE 1

Every service in the compose will be configured with this default network.

```docker
docker container inspect container-name
```

-------- IMAGE 2

Docker uses the default created network for connections between services. This allows a service connect to another using the name of the service as an alias for the host address.
Imagine two services in a compose: curl and app. Curl could connect to app using
```bash
curl http://app
```
